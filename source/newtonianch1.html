<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >When two objects hit each other, all sorts of things might happen. Either
or both object might be profoundly affected by the interaction as, for
example, when a car hits a lamp post at high speed. Physical effects may be
emitted such as in the form of sound waves, elctromagnetic radiation or
heat.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >An ellastic collision is an idealised collision where none of these things happen.
The objects remain unchanged and, in particular, no energy is emitted in the
process. While this is idealised it is a rough approximation to the collisions of
billiard balls - although a small amount of sound energy is emitted in the form of
the sharp crack when they hit.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Knowing that a collision is elastic makes things much easier because it means
that there is an overall conservation of both energy and momentum. No energy
is lost, for example in doing work to deform one object, and nothing is lost.
This makes the ellastic collision of bodies a neat place to learn a little
about Newtonian dyanmics. But even here there are going to be some
subtlties.
